# Install-github.io
---
These are the installation files necessary for installing rvm, jekyll, and github-pages.

Running install.sh will install rvm, jekyll and github-pages.
It will then check your list of repositories on GitHub for a github.io repo.  
If found, the script will clone the repo locally.  
If not found, the script will create a new jekyll website, initialize a repo for it, and add that repo remotely to GitHub.
